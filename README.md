# ImageTheming

Change the color palette of an image to match your theme.

## Getting Started

Use `java -jar path/to/ImageTheming.jar -h` to get all available options that can/need to be set, to generate an image.
There must always be exactly one path and one theme for the program to work. An error message will appear if some 
options are set incorrect. Simple example:  
```shell
java -jar ImageTheming.jar https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73987329\?v\=4 --theme=omni
```
This will select the image from the [link](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73987329\?v\=4) (a path instead of a 
link is also possible) and select the color scheme to be 
[Omni](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mayccoll/Gogh/master/themes/omni.sh).
